What specific data has been collected for analysis? Are there any limitations or gaps in the data that might affect the analysis?
How are years at the company calculated? Is it based on tenure or hire date?
Have reasons for leaving been recorded for each departing employee? If so, what categories do these reasons fall into e.g. better job opportunity, dissatisfaction with management, relocation?

Based on these insights, it appears that factors such as age, gender, salary, job role, and education field significantly influence attrition rates within the organization. Further analysis could delve into reasons behind these trends and formulate strategies to mitigate attrition, such as targeted retention programs, career development initiatives, and salary adjustments.
